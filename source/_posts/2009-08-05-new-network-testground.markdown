My family has 3 routers. An old D-Link, a new Linksys N router, and another router that looks like a mac. After cleaning out my closet, I moved all my old computers, the old PC, an old iMac running Yellow Dog Linux (Soon to be ubuntu) and the iBook into the closet, and networked in with the router that looks like a mac (white and clear plastic and sort of round.) I am now making a rather small network and testing nfs and various other things on the network. I haven't connected the closet router to the outside internet, but I can use a mac laptop to inject the wireless signal into an ethernet wire to install software. An interesting and continuing experiment. Expect more updates.
