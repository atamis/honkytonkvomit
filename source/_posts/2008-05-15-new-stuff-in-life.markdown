Hi all

 

Still no new news from Ambrosia. While browsing the thread where the aquaria beta testers hang out until the beta is released, it was mentioned that <a title="CodeWeavers" href="http://www.codeweavers.com/" target="_blank">CodeWeavers</a> have released CrossOver. With it, they made CrossOver Games. CrossOver Games is design specifically for games and for the ones they support, it works perfectly. Now, there is a linux and mac version, so I can test the app. For a long time, some friends of mine have played Guild Wars for some time. Now me, not having the required PC, couldn't play with them. I went through a tenuous time during last summer because I was trying to duel boot my mac using Boot Camp, so I could play Guild Wars with them. This failed, and the only reason I didn't blog about this is because I had a back up, so I didn't lose anything really important. So, when I heard that I might be able to play with them, I immediately downloaded and installed the app. I had an old Guild Wars installer lying around from some experiments with my other, out dated, PC (these didn't work.) I gave the app the installer, and after hanging around for a bit, it spit out a working version of Guild Wars. I could see the login screen, read the news, even look longingly at the place where I might put in my access code. But no, I didn't have any access code, so I quit the app. Then I remembered that my friends might have had some demo keys for Guild Wars lying about, so I asked them if they did. They said that they didn't have any keys, and that they were amazed that I had gotten GW working on my mac. I tried some other apps, but they didn't work, so, I tried installing Half Life 2. Well, I needed an installer for that, and I didn't want to go hunting for one, so I gave up that. I also tried the PC version of Aquaria, but that wouldn't install, so I am back to square two, because I have a way, to play a game, just I don't have a game. Well, thats all for now, bye!
