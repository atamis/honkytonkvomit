Hello!

So, I recently got an Acer netbook, an Acer Aspire One, to be exact. It was BoB, or Broken out of Box. The screen was VERY weird. Only about half of it worked, with the other half either showing nothing or mirroring pixels. Quite weird. So I sent in in for repair, and I haven't got it back yet. Can't wait for it, I am trying to choose between installing Fedora 10, and Ubuntu. Anybody have anything to weigh in on that?
