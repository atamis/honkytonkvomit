Hi all,

Last Wednesday, (the 23 of April). I had a dream. This dream had me at school, checking the <a title="Link to the Ambrosia Software Website." href="http://www.ambrosiasw.com" target="_blank">Ambrosia Software website</a>, where then had announced the release of Aquaria for Mac. Aquaria is a cool side scroller, the windows version of which, was made by <a title="//bit-blot.com/" href="http://bit-blot.com/" target="_blank">Bit-Blot</a>. When I woke up from this dream, I got up, and checked the Ambrosia <a title="The link to the upcoming page for Ambrosia Software." href="http://www.ambrosiasw.com/news/upcoming/" target="_blank">Upcoming Page</a>. Ambrosia's <a title="The link to the upcoming page for Ambrosia Software." href="http://www.ambrosiasw.com/news/upcoming/" target="_blank">Upcoming Page</a> is where the Ambrosia team say what games they have coming up in the near future, along with beta, alpha, and release candidate information, plus a little blurb on the game or utility. The page said that the game was in closed beta, when it had previously been in alpha. It included a link to a thread on the <a title="The link to the Ambrosia Forums" href="http://www.ambrosiasw.com/forums/" target="_blank">Ambrosia Forums</a> where you could get more information. I clicked on the link, wanting to get into the closed beta. This thread had information on where I could email, what to put in the title, and what to put in the body, if I wanted to apply to be a beta tester. I, of course, sent off my email detailing the needed information. Here is a transcript:
<p style="padding-left:30px;"><em>I have an iMac core 2 duo, and a 2 button mouse with a scroll wheel. I have the latest version of tiger (10.4.10 or 11).</em></p>

<div style="padding-left:30px;"><em>I really hope that I get to beta test. I had a dream that evolved aquaria, so I check the website.</em></div>

Yeah, I was in a hurry. For the rest of Wednesday, and most of thursday, I waited, check my email constantly. finally, at 4:44, on Thursday, Apr 24, 2008, I got the email. It said that I was accepted, and I would be getting an email in about a week. I told my family, and now I wait. Still no email as of 4:18, on Saturday, the 26th.
