hi all

As most of you are, I am sure, in school, so am I. School is alright, etc. I am reading ghe third book of the Inheritance trilogy, Brisinger, and I might beat the record for reading it in my circles of three days, cool. I don't know if you know, but I am making great use of Google Docs for word prossessing, because if I used word, the best solution they (the tech people at my school) have is "email it to your self," which I hate because it gums up my inbox, and use a flash stick, which I might lose. Anyway, so long.
