<h1>I am pleased to announce <a title="BerryConf's page on Github" href="http://github.com/indigo747/BerryConf">BerryConf</a>!</h1>
BerryConf is a simple but easy to use Java library for parsing and managing configuration files! It's still in beta, but it works well, and I'm using a very similar system in one of my latest projects, which I can't say a whole lot about, but It is looking quite cool. So anyway, check out BerryConf if you're looking for such a library.
