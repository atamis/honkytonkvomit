Push_dir is a quick and dirty little ruby gem that simplifies working directory management, allowing you to write code looking like this:

```
include PushDir

push_dir '/' do
     # What you do here will be in '/'
end
# While what you do here will be where you were last.
```

You can see it <a title="push_dir github repo" href="https://github.com/indigo747/push_dir">here</a>, or nab the gem with `gem install push_dir`
