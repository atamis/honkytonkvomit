APG is really quite an interesting program. It randomly generates passwords. Big deal, I can write a ruby program that does that in one line. However, APG makes passwords that can be pronounced. This is amazingly useful. This means that you can choose a good, strong password, that you can easily remember.Â  In Ubuntu, you can install it with <em>sudo apt-get install apg</em>. It's quite usefull.
