I've been playing around with the Land of Lisp, which is an awesome book written for Common Lisp, Gnu Clisp to be specific. So, I like vim, and I like SnipMate, but SnipMate doesn't ship with any lisp snippets, and I couldn't find any on github, so I wrote my own, albeit incomplete, set. You can find it <a title="Clisp Snippets" href="https://github.com/indigo747/vim-snipmate-clisp">here</a>, and it is designed to work with Pathogen.
