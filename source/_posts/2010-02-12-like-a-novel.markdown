So you know how in stories the brash, stupid young hero, usually a mage, learns of forbidden knowledge and reaches higher than he should? I feel sort of like that, only with out the terrible retribution. In my continued quest to build a java game around simulating a farm (a recent project,) I have separated game logic from the gui, as a good programmer should, and built the game logic. Well, I'm sure I'm going to add more to it, but I think it's pretty finished. OK, I have barely worked on it, and it needs a lot of work. However, I wanted <span style="text-decoration:line-through;">a nice</span> an interface to play the game with. So I reached for the forbidden and arcane knowledge of gui creation, and I reached for it by taking a short cut through NetBeans, and I can tell you, it hasn't been fun. Really. More than that, a command line interface also eluded me some how, with infinite loops and no input everywhere. I feel properly chastised. I guess I'll go sit in a corner.
