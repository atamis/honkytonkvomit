Planet 5 is slow paced survival RTS. It is set on a hostile alien planet
populated by murderous aliens trying to kill you. You must defend yourself for
as long as possible. Spread your network across the alien planet with relays,
generate and store energy with capacitors and solar farms, research and improve
your buildings with the science lab, and defend the rest of your buildings with
powerful laser turrets and mortars.

Developed by me and James Zhang as the final project for UCSC COSMOS Cluster 5.
