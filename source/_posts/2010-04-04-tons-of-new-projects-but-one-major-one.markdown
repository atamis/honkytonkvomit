I am working on a lot of programing projects over break, but one major one is going to see most of my attention. It is called Rorth, and it is an interpreted, stack based language based on Forth. You can find it at <a href="http://github.com/indigo747/Rorth">http://github.com/atamis/Rorth</a> The latest version, 0.1.1, works. Hazzah. Everything else is pretty bare bones at this point.
